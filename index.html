      <p>This is a website dedicated to helping people get control of aspects of their lives where they feel they are lacking. The idea came from me forgetting to pay my car registration because I didn't update my address when i moved. It hadn't occurred to me that i needed to update my address at that time. There are many little things in life like this which might not be explicitly told to us when we move out for the first time. This app seeks to fill in those gaps and serve as a basic guide book on how to be an adult. It will help people set a new minimum standard for themselves, hence the name new minimum.</p>
